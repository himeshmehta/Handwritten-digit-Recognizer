# Handwritten-digit-classification
This projects deals with MNIST dataset to classify handwritten digit.
Dataset can be found from kaggle or we can load the dataset from keras.datasets.mnist.
This dataset contain 60000 training samples and 10000 validation sample.
First I build model using neural network (multilayer perceptron) . The accuracy obtained from this model is 98.27 %

Model 1:- Using Neural Network               Accuracy = 98.27 %
Model 2:- Using Logistic Regression          Accuracy = 98.27 %
